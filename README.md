MyJavaRepository
================

Code is located in Java directory

To compile use bin/compile.sh.

To run use bin/run.bat.

There is an issue in reading from the console in cygwin bash shell so just use DOS for now.

The During initialisation some auto test routines run and some dummy data is loaded.

Then over to some console commands.

Here is an example.

Fred subscribe
Fred follows Alice
Fred                                      -- lists messages
Fred -> Hi Alice                          -- posting message
Alice follows Fred
Alice
Alice -> Hi Fred
Exit

Hope this is what you are looking for.
